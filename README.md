# What is Yap?

Yap is a part of a project plan where I would have to create a web project for every month in the span of 3. Yap itself is the first out of three project that I will be creating for this plan, and is intended to be a blog style sites where users are able to:

- Sign up and create accounts
- Make their own blog page
- Like and comment on other's blogs
- Delete own blogs and comments
- Subscribe to other's blog page
- Log in as an admin with administrative privileges

# What is this 3 months project plan?

This project plan has been developed to leverage and further enhance my web development skills, demonstrating my capabilities to potential employers. Additionally, it serves as preparation for the WorldSkills Australia 2025 National Web Design & Development Competition, allowing me to refine my expertise in the field.
